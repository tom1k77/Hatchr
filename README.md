Hatchr — Lightpaper / Builder Documentation (MVP)

1. Overview

Hatchr is a Base-native token discovery and signal platform designed to help users identify promising tokens early by combining onchain data and social signals.

Core idea:

Too many tokens, too little signal. Hatchr aggregates, scores, and surfaces what matters — early.

Target users:
	•	Base traders
	•	Early token hunters
	•	Builders tracking ecosystem momentum


2. Problem
	•	Hundreds of tokens launch daily on Base (Zora, Clanker, etc).
	•	Information is fragmented across:
   - launchpads
   - explorers
	 - X
	 - Farcaster
	•	Traders miss early opportunities or react too late.
	•	No unified signal layer focused specifically on Base.


3. Solution

Hatchr provides:
	•	Unified token feed (Zora + Clanker → expanding to full Base ecosystem)
	•	Hatchr Score — a composite metric combining:
	 - liquidity & price data
	 - social credibility
	 - activity & momentum
	•	Token cards with real-time insights
	•	Future: alerts, social news, trading access


4. Current MVP (What’s live)

✅ Aggregation of tokens from:
	•	Zora
	•	Clanker

✅ Hatchr Score (v1):
	•	Activity
	•	Social presence (Neynar-based signals)

✅ Token pages:
	•	Price
	•	Liquidity
	•	Basic analytics
	•	External links

✅ Live demo:
	•	URL: https://hatchr.vercel.app


5. Hatchr Score (High-level)

Hatchr Score is designed to surface early momentum without rewarding spam.

Inputs (MVP):
	•	Liquidity depth
	•	Price behavior
	•	Social activity (Farcaster / Neynar)
	•	Account quality signals

The score is intentionally simple at MVP stage and will evolve as more data sources are added.


6. Roadmap (Grant Scope)

Phase 1 — Token Universe Expansion
	•	Index major Base launchpads
	•	Include direct contract deployments
	•	Add “reputation tokens” (established Base projects)

Phase 2 — Social Signals Layer
	•	X mentions:
	 - contract address
	 - ticker
	•	Trusted account whitelist
	•	News surfaced directly on token pages

Phase 3 — Distribution
	•	Farcaster mini app
	•	Base App integration

Phase 4 — Alerts & Notifications
	•	New high-score token alerts
	•	Sudden social momentum alerts
	•	Bullish news alerts


7. Why Base
	•	Hatchr is Base-only by design
	•	Built to strengthen:
   - token discovery
	 - trading activity
	 - ecosystem visibility
	•	Direct value for Base users, traders, and builders

Hatchr acts as an information layer that helps Base users move faster and with more confidence.


8. Open & Extensible
	•	Public frontend
	•	Clear roadmap toward:
   - APIs
	 - integrations
	 - ecosystem tooling

Future potential:
	•	Public Hatchr Score API
	•	Partner integrations with Base-native apps
	•	Community-curated signals


9. Grant Usage

Funds will be used for:
	•	Backend development
	•	Indexing infrastructure
	•	Social signal processing
	•	Alert & notification systems

Outcome:
A stronger, more informative Base ecosystem with better signal discovery.
