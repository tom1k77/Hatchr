# Hatchr — Lightpaper / Builder Documentation (MVP)

Hatchr is a **Base-native token discovery and signal platform** designed to help users identify promising tokens early by combining onchain data and social signals.

> **Core idea:**  
> Too many tokens, too little signal. Hatchr aggregates, scores, and surfaces what matters — early.

**Target users**
- Base traders  
- Early token hunters  
- Builders tracking ecosystem momentum  

---

## 1. Problem

Hundreds of tokens launch daily on Base (Zora, Clanker, direct deploys).

Information is fragmented across:
- Launchpads
- Explorers
- Social platforms:
  - X 
  - Farcaster

As a result:
- Traders miss early opportunities or react too late
- Signals appear first in social, not dashboards
- There is no unified **Base-focused signal layer**

---

## 2. Solution

Hatchr provides:

- **Unified token feed**
  - Zora
  - Clanker
  - Expanding to the full Base ecosystem
- **Hatchr Score**
  - Liquidity & price data
  - Social credibility
  - Activity & momentum
- **Token cards**
  - Real-time insights
  - Key metrics and links

**Planned:** alerts, social news, and direct trading access.

## 3. Current MVP (What’s Live)

✅ **Token aggregation**
- Zora
- Clanker

✅ **Hatchr Score (v1)**
- Activity signals
- Social presence (Neynar-based)

✅ **Token pages**
- Price
- Liquidity
- Basic analytics
- External links

## 4. Hatchr Score (High-level)

Hatchr Score is designed to surface **early momentum without rewarding spam**.

**Inputs (MVP):**
- Liquidity depth
- Price behavior
- Social activity (Farcaster / Neynar)
- Account quality signals

The score is intentionally simple at the MVP stage and will evolve as more data sources are added.

---

## 5. Roadmap (Grant Scope)

### Phase 1 — Token Universe Expansion
- Index major Base launchpads
- Include direct contract deployments
- Add “reputation tokens” (established Base projects)

### Phase 2 — Social Signals Layer
- X mentions:
  - Contract address
  - Ticker
- Trusted account whitelist
- Social news surfaced on token pages

### Phase 3 — Distribution
- Farcaster mini app
- Base App integration

### Phase 4 — Alerts & Notifications
- New high-score token alerts
- Sudden social momentum alerts
- Bullish news alerts

---

## 6. Why Base

- Hatchr is **Base-only by design**
- Built to strengthen:
  - Token discovery
  - Trading activity
  - Ecosystem visibility

Hatchr acts as an **information layer** that helps Base users move faster and with more confidence.

---

## 7. Open & Extensible

- Public frontend
- Clear roadmap toward:
  - APIs
  - Integrations
  - Ecosystem tooling

**Future potential**
- Public Hatchr Score API
- Partner integrations with Base-native apps
- Community-curated signals

---

## 8. Grant Usage

Funds will be used for:
- Backend development
- Indexing infrastructure
- Social signal processing
- Alert & notification systems

**Outcome:**  
A stronger, more informative Base ecosystem with better signal discovery.
